Kanban Board React App Overview
Welcome to the Kanban Board React App repository. This application serves the purpose of creating a dynamic and user-centric Kanban board, allowing users to interact with the data from a provided API. The primary functionality of this app revolves around grouping and ordering options, adapting the Kanban board's content based on user preferences.

Grouping Your Tasks
The app empowers users with three distinct grouping options:

By Status: Easily organize tasks based on their current status. This visual grouping provides a clear overview of the progress of each task.

By User: Arrange tasks according to the assigned users. This feature streamlines collaboration and helps users focus on their assigned responsibilities.

By Priority: Group tasks based on their priority level. This ensures that high-priority tasks are readily identifiable and can be addressed promptly.

Ordering for Clarity
Users have the flexibility to sort their displayed tasks in two different ways:

Priority Order: This arranges tasks in descending order of priority, ensuring that the most critical tasks are at the forefront.

Title Order: Sort tasks in ascending order based on their title. This allows for easy navigation and reference, especially for tasks with similar priorities.

Eye-Catching Design
The Kanban board is designed with user experience in mind. Its responsive and visually appealing layout ensures an enjoyable and efficient task management process.

Prioritizing Your Work
The Kanban board recognizes five priority levels for tasks:

Urgent (Priority level 4)
High (Priority level 3)
Medium (Priority level 2)
Low (Priority level 1)
No Priority (Priority level 0)
With this Kanban board, you can enhance your task management and collaboration capabilities, all while maintaining a visually pleasing and intuitive user interface.
